# BadgeFactory

BadgeFactory - A MorphL2 Sparkloom hackathon POC for the product

Structure:

1. BadgeFactory_SmartContracts - Smart contracts for MorphL2, Hardhat
2. BadgeFactory_Dashboard - Deployment control panel for system users, Nextjs
3. BadgeFactory_Mobile - Mobile app for customers to store their rewards/tickets/coupons and generate qr code to scan/verify to redeem/claim loyalty offers

This hackathon submission goal would be finished SmartContracts and some part of dashboard for easy access and visibility into whole vision of BadgeFactory.
More will be added here as I progress on creating BadgeFactory for this hackathon (MorphL2 Sparkloom)
