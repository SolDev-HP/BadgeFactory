BadgeFactory - Mobile app

- IF we ever reach here in this hackathon, here's the basic idea about this crucial component in BadgeFactory as a whole product package.

Customers can use this mobile application to

- Create account + wallet where all BadgeFactory issued rewards and loyalty badges are displayed
- Generate a QR code based on which project/product/brand they are accessing and this QR code then can be scanned by merchants to redeem + claim reward points or loyalty offer
